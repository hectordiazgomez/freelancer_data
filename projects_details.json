Rather than being in a state of hassle to push an agenda that has meant to not be possible, Sach became my best ally and a library of knowledge toward how I could possibly exploit them and make a change that would end on giving the same results as my initial goals.\nThat was a real collaboration, a true commitment in a daily basis of working process which i gladly took because i truly believe in my software concept and when you think something is worth to be real, everything should be done to make it possible and Sach has perfectly responded to all my expectations.\nI would recommend anyone to sign for Sach and his Team if you want to give life to your project ! \nDiscuss toward the matter, face the challenges and create a better alternative. That’s what I learned from him !\nSincerly, Assin Bouacherine",
